===========

`Blubber bots`_ are inexpensive robot blimps.  They were designed by
`Jed Berk`_ and are descended from his work with `Autonomous Light Air
Vessels`_ (ALAVs).

The blubber bot that you can `buy through the Maker Shed Store`_ has
two motors, two light sensors, a bump sensor, a piezo speaker, a
vibrator, and a cell phone signal detector.  Its brain is an
Arduino-compatible AVR ATmega168V microcontroller.

This `repository`_ contains a copy of the Arduino sketches that make up
the blimp's control code, generously made available by Jed Berk.
