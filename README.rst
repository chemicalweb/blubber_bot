===========

`Blubber bots`_ are inexpensive robot blimps.  They were designed by Jed
Berk and are descended from his work with `Autonomous Light Air Vessels`_ (ALAVs).

The blubber bot that you can `buy through the Maker Shed Store`_ has two
motors, two light sensors, a bump sensor, a piezo speaker, a vibrator.
Its brain is an Arduino-compatible AVR ATmega168V microcontroller.

This repository contains the Arduino sketches that make up the blimp's control code.
